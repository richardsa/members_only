#Project 2: Members Only!
Rails project created for <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication?ref=lnav">The Odin Project</a>

In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Check <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication?ref=lnav">The Odin Project</a> website for full instructions.
